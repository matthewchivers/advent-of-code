# Advent of Code 2024 - Day 2

In this readme I detail the puzzle instructions from [adventofcode.com/2024/day/2](https://adventofcode.com/2024/day/2) along with the answers to the puzzle, and any explanation on how I solved it. I typically try to comment the code in such a way that further explanation is not needed, but if things are particularly peculiar then I'll write a little something here.

## Instruction Summary

The engineers at the Red-Nosed reactor need help analysing reports of levels to determine safety. The first task is to count the reports where levels are either all increasing or decreasing, with adjacent levels differing by 1 to 3 (e.g., 2 safe reports in the example). The second task allows the **Problem Dampener** to remove one bad level per report, enabling additional reports to be considered safe if this adjustment makes them valid (e.g., 4 safe reports in the example).
