# Advent of Code 2024 Solutions 🎄✨

Another year, another round of festive brain teasers! Here you'll find my [Advent of Code 2024](https://adventofcode.com/2024) solutions — each day bringing its own set of puzzles to dig into and enjoy. Whether it was a quick solve or a deeper challenge, it's all about embracing the problem-solving spirit.

## What's Inside?

Each day of Advent of Code 2024 has its own folder, which includes:

- **The Solution**: Written in Go, showcasing how I approached each puzzle.
- **A README**: A quick overview of the challenge for that day.
- **Test Cases**: Unit tests to keep things running smoothly—because a little rigour goes a long way.

## Running the Solutions

If you want to give any of the solutions a go, just jump into the right folder and run it:

```bash
cd 01  # Replace with the desired day
go run main.go
```

## Testing the Solutions

To make sure everything’s in good shape:

- **Run all tests**: `make test`
- **Day-specific tests**: `make test-day DAY=01`  # Replace with the desired day

Feel free to poke around, grab some ideas, or see how I tackled each day's puzzle. There's nothing quite like a bit of coding to brighten up the holiday season—let's make it a good one! 🚀✨

And here's a festive joke to leave you with:

Why did the developer go broke at Christmas? Because they used up all their cache on presents! 🎁😆
