# Advent of Code 2024 - Day 1

In this readme I detail the puzzle instructions from [adventofcode.com/2024/day/1](https://adventofcode.com/2024/day/1) along with the answers to the puzzle, and any explanation on how I solved it. I typically try to comment the code in such a way that further explanation is not needed, but if things are particularly peculiar then I'll write a little something here.

## Instruction Summary

The Elves are trying to reconcile two lists of location IDs to find the missing Chief Historian. The first task is to calculate the total distance between the lists by pairing the smallest numbers from each list and summing the absolute differences between them (e.g., 11 in the example). The second task involves finding a similarity score by summing each number in the left list multiplied by the number of times it appears in the right list (e.g., 31 in the example).
