# Advent of Code 2024 - Day 6

In this readme I detail the puzzle instructions from [adventofcode.com/2024/day/6](https://adventofcode.com/2024/day/6) along with the answers to the puzzle, and any explanation on how I solved it. I typically try to comment the code in such a way that further explanation is not needed, but if things are particularly peculiar then I'll write a little something here.

## Instruction Summary

In *Guard Gallivant*, we travel to the North Pole's prototype suit manufacturing lab in 1518, where a guard patrols a cluttered map following strict rules: they turn right whenever they face an obstacle; otherwise, they take a step forward. In part one, we need to figure out how many unique positions the guard visits before leaving the map. In part two, we work with *The Historians* to place a single new obstacle that traps the guard in a loop, letting them search the lab safely without causing a time paradox. This task is all about predicting the guardâ€™s movements and carefully planning the obstacle placement.
