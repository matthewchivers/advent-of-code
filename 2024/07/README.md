# Advent of Code 2024 - Day 7

In this readme I detail the puzzle instructions from [adventofcode.com/2024/day/7](https://adventofcode.com/2024/day/7) along with the answers to the puzzle, and any explanation on how I solved it. I typically try to comment the code in such a way that further explanation is not needed, but if things are particularly peculiar then I'll write a little something here.

## Instruction Summary: Bridge Repair

The instructions describe a broken rope bridge where engineers need help fixing calibration equations after mischievous elephants disrupted them. The task involves inserting addition and multiplication operators between numbers to match the test values, evaluating strictly left-to-right without rearranging. Initially, three equations are valid, yielding a calibration total. In Part Two, a new concatenation operator (||) is introduced, enabling additional equations to match their test values and increasing the total. The goal is to determine all valid equations using the operators and calculate their combined test values.
