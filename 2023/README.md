# Advent of Code 2023 Solutions ðŸŽ„âœ¨

Welcome to my [Advent of Code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023) solutions! This is where Iâ€™ve collected my attempts at solving the daily puzzles â€” some straightforward, some a bit of a head-scratcher, but all in the spirit of a fun coding challenge.

## What's Inside?

Each day of Advent of Code 2023 has its own folder, which includes:

- **The Solution**: Written in Go, showcasing how I approached each puzzle.
- **A README**: A quick overview of the challenge for that day.
- **Test Cases**: Unit tests to keep things running smoothlyâ€”because a little rigour goes a long way.

## Running the Solutions

If you want to give any of the solutions a go, just jump into the right folder and run it:

```bash
cd 01  # Replace with the desired day
go run main.go
```

## Testing the Solutions

To make sure everythingâ€™s in good shape:

- **Run all tests**: `make test`
- **Day-specific tests**: `make test-day DAY=01`  # Replace with the desired day

Take a peek, grab some ideas, or have a go at the puzzles yourself. Coding during the festive season is always a good timeâ€”so dig in, and enjoy the ride! ðŸš€âœ¨
