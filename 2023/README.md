# Advent of Code 2023 Solutions ðŸŽ„âœ¨

Welcome to the upcoming journey through the Advent of Code 2023! This directory will be dedicated to my solutions for this year's set of puzzles. As the challenges unfold, this will become a repository of creativity and problem-solving.

## 2023: Anticipating New Challenges

This section is poised to host a directory for each day of the Advent of Code 2023 as they are completed. You can expect:

- **The Solution:** Crafted in Go, these will be my approaches to the daily puzzles.
- **A README:** Providing a succinct overview of each day's challenge.
- **Test Cases:** Unit tests to validate and ensure the correctness of the solutions.

## Preparing to Run the Solutions

Once the challenge begins and solutions are added, you'll be able to run each day's solution:

\```bash
cd 01  # Replace with the desired day
go run main.go
\```

## Testing the Future Solutions

The robustness of the solutions will be ensured through thorough tests:

- Run tests for all days: `make test`
- Run tests for a specific day: `make test-day DAY=01` # Replace with the desired day

## The Adventure Ahead

While the 2023 puzzles haven't started yet, I'm eagerly awaiting the challenges it will bring. This directory will become a testament to the learning and growth experienced through each puzzle. 

Stay tuned as the days unfold and the coding adventure progresses! ðŸš€ðŸŒŸ
