# 2023 Day 1: Trebuchet?!

Using puzzle from the [website 2023/day/1](https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/1).

The Elves are using a trebuchet to launch you into the sky to fix snow production issues, but their calibration document has been altered by a young Elf. The first task is to recover calibration values by combining the first and last digits on each line and summing these values (e.g., 142 in the example). The second task expands this to include digits spelled out as words (e.g., "two" or "nine") when identifying the first and last digits, then recalculating the sum of calibration values (e.g., 281 in the example).
