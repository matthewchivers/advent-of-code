# 2023 Day 2: Cube Conundrum?!

Using puzzle from the [website 2023/day/2](https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/2).

The Elf on Snow Island introduces a game where you deduce cube counts from observations. The first task is to determine which games could have been played with a bag containing 12 red, 13 green, and 14 blue cubes, summing the IDs of those possible games (e.g., 8 in the example). The second task is to find the minimum number of red, green, and blue cubes needed for each game and calculate the sum of their powers (the product of the cube counts) across all games (e.g., 2286 in the example).
