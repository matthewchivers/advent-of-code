# 2023 Day 4: Scratchcards

Using puzzle from the [website 2023/day/4](https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/4).

There is a pile of scratched-off scratch-cards. The first task is to calculate the total points for the cards, where the first match earns one point and each subsequent match doubles the card's score (e.g., 13 points in the example). The second task involves determining the total number of original and copied scratchcards won, as each match grants copies of subsequent cards, which are scored recursively (e.g., 30 total cards in the example).
