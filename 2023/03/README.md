# 2023 Day 3: Gear Ratios

Using puzzle from the [website 2023/day/3](https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/3).

The gondola lift is broken, and the missing engine part needs identifying. The first task is to calculate the sum of all part numbers, which are numbers adjacent to symbols (not including periods) in the engine schematic (e.g., 4361 in the example). The second task is to find all gears—symbols (*) adjacent to exactly two part numbers—calculate their gear ratios (the product of those two numbers), and sum these ratios to identify the faulty gear (e.g., 467,835 in the example).
