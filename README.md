# Advent of Code ðŸŽ„âœ¨

Welcome to my Advent of Code repository! This is where I put my solutions for [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) puzzles, which I tackle each year for a bit of festive fun. If you're here, I assume you either like a good puzzle or are just curious about my approach. Either way, you're welcome to have a look around.

## What's in Here?

- **Yearly Directories**: Each year's puzzles are tucked neatly into their own folder.
- **Daily Solutions**: Each day's challenge gets its own solution, and, when I'm feeling ambitious, a bit of commentary.
- **Tests**: Yep, there are tests. Even fun should be done right.

## Participation and Plans

I've partially completed 2022 and 2023, and I'm looking forward to tackling the 2024 challenges. The ultimate aim is to eventually complete every challenge for every year. Feel free to take a peek at my progress so far:

- [**2022 Solutions**](./2022/)
- [**2023 Solutions**](./2023/)
- [**2024 Solutions**](./2024/)

## Running the Solutions

If you want to run any of the solutions, just navigate to the specific year's folder and the day's directory, then fire it up with Go:

```bash
cd 2022/01  # e.g. Day 1 of 2022
go run main.go
```

## Testing

Because what's a solution without a bit of verification:

- **Run all tests**: `make test`
- **Year-specific tests**: `make test-year YEAR=2022`
- **Day-specific tests**: `make test-day YEAR=2022 DAY=01`
- **Benchmarks**: `make benchmark`

## Dive In

This repository is a bit of a mixed bag: part problem-solving practice, part festive tradition. I keep it organised and professional where it counts, but itâ€™s mostly here because I love the challenge. Feel free to explore, borrow ideas, make suggestions, or just see how someone else approaches these puzzles.

Happy coding, and may your December be full of interesting problems and just enough coffee to solve them! â˜•âœ¨
