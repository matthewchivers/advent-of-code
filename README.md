# Advent Of Code ðŸŽ„âœ¨

Welcome to my comprehensive repository for all my [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) solutions. This repository is a collection of my journey through the annual Advent of Code - a series of challenging and engaging programming puzzles set during the festive season. Here, you'll find my solutions, methodologies, and insights gained from each year's challenges.

## Repository Structure

Organized by year, this repository encapsulates the essence of problem-solving and programming skills honed over time. For each year, you'll find:

- **Yearly Directories:** Each year of participation has its dedicated directory.
- **Daily Solutions:** Solutions for each day's puzzle within the respective year's directory.
- **Readme Files:** Overview and reflections on the puzzles, my approach, and the learning outcomes.
- **Test Cases:** Unit tests to validate and ensure the robustness of each solution.

## Participated Years

- [**2022 Solutions**](./2022/): The first year I embarked on this coding adventure, where each day presented a new set of intriguing problems. Here's where my Advent of Code journey began in earnest. [Link to Advent Of Code 2022 Challenges](https://adventofcode.com/2022)

## Upcoming: Advent of Code 2023

With anticipation, I am gearing up for the Advent of Code 2023. This upcoming edition promises to bring more challenging and exciting puzzles. Stay tuned for the solutions and experiences from this year's adventure!

## Running the Solutions

To run any specific solution, navigate to the year and day directory, and execute the Go file:

\```bash
cd 2022/01  # Example for Day 1 of 2022
go run main.go
\```

## Testing the Solutions

To ensure the accuracy and efficiency of the solutions, tests can be run as follows:

- Run tests for all years and days: `make test`
- Run tests for all days in a year: `make test-year YEAR=2022`
- Run tests for a specific day: `make test-day YEAR=2022 DAY=01`

## Join the Journey

Feel free to explore the puzzles and solutions. Each year's directory is a saga of its own, filled with unique challenges and learnings.

Happy coding, and may your festive season be filled with joy and interesting problems to solve! ðŸš€ðŸŒŸ
