# Day 2: Rock Paper Scissors 

Using puzzle from the [website 2022/day/2](https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/2).

The Elves hold a Rock Paper Scissors tournament to decide tent placement near the snack storage, and one Elf gives you an encrypted strategy guide. The first task is to calculate your total score if you follow the guide assuming the second column specifies the shape you should play (e.g., 15 in the example). The second task is to calculate your total score when interpreting the second column as the required outcome of each round (e.g., 12 in the example).
