## Summary:
Santa's reindeer need magical energy from star fruit to deliver presents, so the Elves embark on a jungle expedition to gather it. To keep track of resources, they inventory the Calories carried by each Elf. The first task is to find the Elf carrying the most Calories (e.g., 24,000 in the example). The second task is to determine the combined Calories of the top three Elves carrying the most (e.g., 45,000).
