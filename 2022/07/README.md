# Day 7: No Space Left On Device

Using puzzle from the [website 2022/day/7](https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/7).

The Elves' filesystem is full, and they need to free up space for a system update. The first task is to identify all directories with a total size of at most 100,000 and calculate the sum of their sizes (e.g., 95,437 in the example). The second task is to determine the smallest directory that can be deleted to free up enough space for the update, considering the required unused space of at least 30,000,000 (e.g., directory `d` with size 24,933,642 in the example).
