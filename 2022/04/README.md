# Day 4: Camp Cleanup

Using puzzle from the [website 2022/day/4](https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/4).

The Elves are assigned ranges of section IDs for camp cleanup, but many assignments overlap. The first task is to determine how many assignment pairs have one range fully containing the other (e.g., 2 in the example). The second task is to count how many assignment pairs overlap at all, even partially (e.g., 4 in the example).
