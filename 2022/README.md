# Advent of Code 2022 Solutions ðŸŽ„âœ¨

Welcome to my journey through the Advent of Code 2022! This directory is dedicated to my solutions for this year's fascinating and challenging set of puzzles. Each day brought unique problems, and here you'll find how I tackled them.

## 2022: A Year of Coding Challenges

In this section, you'll find a directory for each day of the Advent of Code 2022. Every directory includes:

- **The Solution:** Written in Go, these solutions are my approach to the daily puzzles.
- **A README:** A brief overview of the day's challenge.
- **Test Cases:** Unit tests to ensure the correctness of the solutions.

## Running the Solutions

To dive into a day's challenge and see the solution in action:

```bash
cd 01  # Replace with the desired day
go run main.go
```

## Testing the Solutions
Ensure the robustness of the solutions with the provided tests:

Run tests for all days: `make test`
Run tests for a specific day: `make test-day DAY=01` # Replace with the desired day

## Journey So Far
The journey through the 2022 puzzles has been both challenging and rewarding. Currently, it extends up to Day 7, showcasing a variety of problem-solving approaches. There's more to come, as I plan to return and complete the remaining challenges.
