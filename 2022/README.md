# Advent of Code 2022 Solutions ðŸŽ„âœ¨

Welcome to my Advent of Code 2022 directory! This is where I tackled the puzzles from 2022, with each day bringing its own coding challenge. Here you'll find how I approached each one.

## What's Inside?

Each day of Advent of Code 2022 has its own folder, which includes:

- **The Solution**: Written in Go, my take on solving the day's puzzle.
- **A README**: A quick overview of the challenge.
- **Test Cases**: Unit tests to keep things working as they should.

## Running the Solutions

Want to run a solution? Just hop into the day's directory and give it a spin:

```bash
cd 01  # Replace with the desired day
go run main.go
```

## Testing the Solutions

To check that everything's working:

- **Run all tests**: `make test`
- **Day-specific tests**: `make test-day DAY=01`  # Replace with the desired day

Feel free to browse, borrow ideas, or just kick back and enjoy the ride. Happy coding, and may the puzzles be ever in your favour! ðŸš€âœ¨
