Using puzzle from the [website 2022/day/6](https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/6).

The Elves' communication device needs to detect specific markers in a datastream of characters. The first task is to identify how many characters must be processed before detecting a start-of-packet marker, defined as the first occurrence of four distinct consecutive characters (e.g., 7 in the example). The second task is to determine the number of characters needed to detect a start-of-message marker, which consists of 14 distinct consecutive characters (e.g., 19 in the example).
