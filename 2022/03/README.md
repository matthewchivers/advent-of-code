# Day 3: Rucksack Reorganization 

Using puzzle from the [website 2022/day/3](https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/3).

Each rucksack has two compartments, but one item type is misplaced between them. The first task is to find the item type that appears in both compartments of each rucksack and calculate the sum of their priorities (e.g., 157 in the example). The second task is to identify the badge item type common across each three-Elf group's rucksacks and calculate the sum of their priorities (e.g., 70 in the example).
