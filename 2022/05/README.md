# Day 5: Supply Stacks

Using puzzle from the [website 2022/day/5](https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/5).

The Elves need to rearrange stacks of crates using a cargo crane to prepare for unloading supplies. The first task is to simulate the crate movements, where crates are moved one at a time, and determine the message formed by the crates on top of each stack after all movements (e.g., CMZ in the example). The second task modifies the simulation to account for the crane's ability to move multiple crates at once while retaining their order, resulting in a different message (e.g., MCD in the example).
